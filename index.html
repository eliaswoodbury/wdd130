    <p>I like to play basketball and surf. I am a computer science major, but I don't really know a lot about it
        I am number 4 of 7 children. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 23 years (My whole life).
        One of my favorite quotes is by F Scott Fitzgerald "Trouble has no necessary connection with discouragement. Discouragement has a germ of its own, as different from trouble as arthritis is different from a stiff joint."
