            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hey kids it's Ya Pops: AKA Elias Woodbury. I am currently a student at BYUI majoring in computer science with an emphasis in machine learning (Artificial Intelligence).&nbsp;
                While I am studying computer science, my plan is to go to Dental School and hopefully specialize in Oral Surgery. Because of that, I have taken many Biology and Chemistry classes,&nbsp;
                and saw an oppurtunity to hone my skills while offering some help and resources to the kids that come after me. When I was kid I learned everything from my dad (He's the best).&nbsp;
                Now I don't get to see my dad as much, but I still remember Christ saying, "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise." (John 5:19)&nbsp;
                As I have gone to tutoring and stretched for success, I have grown more and more grateful for those who came before me and turned back to teach me. I consider them forefathers to my success&nbsp;
                I only hope that like those who came before me, I can turn around and offer help to those who come next. Everything on here is free. &nbsp;
                If you need help or find someone in need of help, schedule a tutoring appointment through BYUI in the link below. And don't forget to tell 'em you learned it from Ya Pops!
